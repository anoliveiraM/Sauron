### Client Agent Code Structure (C++17)

#### Design Patterns
- **Singleton**: For global config and shared resources (e.g., connection manager to backend).
- **Observer**: For event-driven log monitoring (inotify triggers observers for alerts).
- **Factory**: Distro-specific factories for package managers (apt for Ubuntu, yum for CentOS/RedHat).
- **Command**: For management tasks (install, file ops as command objects executed via executor).
- **RAII**: For resource management (e.g., file handles, threads).

#### High-Level Structure
- **main.cpp**: Entry point; initializes daemon, starts threads, handles signals.
- **config/**: Singleton config loader (JSON/INI for backend URL, intervals).
- **metrics/**: 
  - Collector class: Threads for periodic (5s) collection from /proc, /proc/<pid>, statvfs.
  - Pusher: Batches JSON to backend via HTTPS (libcurl).
- **logs/**: 
  - Monitor class: inotify watcher; polls every 30s for <1min latency.
  - Filter: Regex/keyword scanner for alerts; pushes events.
- **management/**: 
  - Executor: Receives commands via SSH/HTTPS; dispatches to handlers.
  - Handlers: Classes for package (Factory), file (<filesystem>), cron (crontab), symlink (symlink()).
- **utils/**: Logging, error handling, threading (std::thread, mutex).
- **daemon/**: Systemd integration; background running.

#### Threading
- Main thread: Command listener.
- Worker threads: Metrics (1), Logs (1), Heartbeat (1).

Compile as RPM/DEB; install as systemd service.
